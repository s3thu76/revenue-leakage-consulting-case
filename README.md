# Revenue Leakage in Subscription Businesses

### A Consulting-Style Analytics Case

This project explores customer churn through a **decision-focused, consulting lens** rather than a purely predictive one.

Instead of asking *“Who is likely to churn?”*, the analysis reframes the problem as:

> **Where is revenue actually being lost — and which actions recover it most cost-effectively?**

The project is structured to reflect how analytics is used in **real consulting and strategy engagements**, where framing, prioritization, and ROI matter more than model complexity.

## Client Context

A subscription-based telecom provider is experiencing **stagnant revenue growth** despite stable customer acquisition.

Leadership suspects:

* Preventable churn
* Misallocated retention spending
* Lack of clarity on which churn actually matters economically

---

## Engagement Objective

Identify:

1. Which customer segments drive the majority of **revenue leakage**
2. What **operational and service factors** explain churn
3. Which retention actions deliver the **highest return on investment**

---

## Key Insights

* **Over 50% of revenue at risk** comes from **mid-tenure, high-value customers**
* The strongest churn drivers are **service expectations and payment friction**, not demographics
* **Targeted service interventions deliver 3–4× higher ROI** than blanket discounts
* Broad, untargeted retention discounts are often **value-destructive**

---

## Analytical Approach

The analysis follows a **McKinsey Digital–style workflow**:

1. **Business framing**
   Reframe churn from a volume problem into a revenue leakage problem

2. **Customer segmentation**
   Segment customers by tenure and ARPU to identify where revenue is concentrated

3. **Interpretable modeling**
   Use logistic regression to surface actionable churn drivers via odds ratios

4. **Decision economics**
   Evaluate retention strategies based on cost, revenue saved, and ROI

## Methods & Tools

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
* Google Colab
* Logistic regression (interpretable modeling)
* ROI simulation and scenario analysis
* Executive-style visualization

## Repository Contents

* `revenue_leakage_analysis.ipynb`
  → End-to-end analysis notebook with business framing, modeling, and ROI logic

* `revenue_leakage_slides.pdf`
  → Executive-style slide deck summarizing insights and recommendations

## Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates that **analytics becomes powerful only when it is tied to decisions**.

The highest-impact retention strategies are not promotional — they are **targeted, operational, and service-oriented**.

not just model optimization.
