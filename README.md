# Revenue Leakage in Subscription Businesses

This project analyzes customer churn through a consulting-style, decision-focused analytics lens.

Instead of asking “Who is likely to churn?”, the analysis reframes the problem as:
**Where is revenue actually being lost — and which actions recover it most cost-effectively?**

---

##  Problem Statement
A subscription-based telecom business faces stagnant revenue despite stable customer acquisition.
Leadership suspects revenue leakage driven by preventable churn and inefficient retention spend.

---

##  Key Insights
• Over **50% of revenue at risk** comes from **mid-tenure, high-value customers**  
• Churn is driven more by **service expectations and payment friction** than demographics  
• **Targeted service interventions deliver 3–4× higher ROI** than blanket discounts  

---

##  Approach
The analysis follows a McKinsey Digital–style workflow:
1. Customer segmentation by tenure and ARPU
2. Interpretable logistic regression to identify churn drivers
3. Retention ROI modeling to evaluate trade-offs

---

##  Methods & Tools
• Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)  
• Google Colab  
• Logistic regression (interpretable modeling)  
• Decision economics & ROI simulation

##  Final Note
This project reflects how analytics is used in real consulting and strategy engagements —
not just model optimization.
